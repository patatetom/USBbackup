# USBbackup : plug ⏬ & backup 🔁
**Simple backup solution on USB media**

USBbackup is a Linux systemd backup solution entirely in user space.

Once properly installed, any USB media with a folder named `USBbackup` at the root of one of its partitions inserted into a USB port becomes a backup media and automatically triggers a backup when inserted.
